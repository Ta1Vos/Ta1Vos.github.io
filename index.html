                                                        concept and make it have a lot of functionality with JS.

                                                        long as you could explain the code.

                                                        many
                                                        solutions and possibilities I could make with JavaScript.
                                                        I discovered new things like: promises, executing functions
                                                        through
                                                        strings, and more!

                                                    <p>For this project we had to make a clothing website, where

                                                        elective part of my study, called Game Production.</p>
                                                    <p>For this I had to investigate on how to create a game, while also
                                                        investigating what to make. It made me think no second about a
                                                        concept
                                                        I've wanted to make reality for a long time.<br>

                                                    <p>When looking at certain topics/concepts, I can find myself loads
                                                        and
                                                        loads of motivation and inspiration to the point I just can't
                                                        stop
                                                        thinking about adding more and more. Just add that little asset,
                                                        oh
                                                        wait! not to forget that other very puzzling asset!</p>
                                                    <p>For most of my school projects I have managed to keep challenging

                                                        to keep adding more until I reach the deadline, of which I had
                                                        fun too.

                                                        Production. This time it is a co-operative project.</p>
                                                    <p>For this we had to pick (or combine) our ideas/concepts we have
                                                        made for
                                                        the previous project to make a new game.</p>
                                                    <p>We decided to use 2 engines in one, one being Phaser and the
                                                        other one
                                                        being Renpy.</p>
                                                    <p>I have worked on the phaser part with someone else, as we were
                                                        the only
                                                        ones who had picked phaser in the previous project. I have
                                                        created most
                                                        of the game's functional assets. <small>(Player, enemies,

                                                            spells)</small> While the other person kept busy with the

                                                        and its collisions.</p>
                                                    <p>We brainstormed the first few classes in order to make a nice
                                                        concept for
                                                        a new game, which we eventually have gotten. A dungeon/magic
                                                        game.</p>
                                                    <p>You have to cast spells in order to defeat the enemies (which are

                                                        of using physical moves too)</p>
                                                    <p>Unfortunately, we greatly overestimated this project, and many

                                                        I have challenged myself multiple times during this project,
                                                        which includes:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>
                                                            A visit counter for every page. This would keep track of
                                                            popular categories and products.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            For the website administrator, a handy way of viewing the
                                                            website as an User, Member and Admin.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            I've added the possibility of uploading images for the
                                                            website administrator. This wasn't required and I've learnt
                                                            this feature after my preparations for the SkillsHeroes.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            The website administrator is also capable of searching
                                                            members & moderating, another feature I've added as an
                                                            addition. The information gets loaded into a select input
                                                            and they can be filtered on username.
                                                        </li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Unfortunately due to the amount of work I had on my hands and
                                                        the <i>not-so-actively-working</i> team member, we've failed to
                                                        finish
                                                        all the features within the time limit. We have missed out on a
                                                        few features which would've been nice to have, but didn't get
                                                        to. Fortunately this didn't affect my grade at a huge amount.

                                                        This is the 10th project, in period 8. This is the last project
                                                        for the 2nd year. I had to work in a team regarding the SCRUM
                                                        again.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For this project I could choose myself what I could make. After
                                                        some brainstorming I decided to create a remaster for one of my
                                                        own projects, called The Path Of The Dabloons.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        One of the requirements was that the project had to make use of
                                                        CRUD and a user/role environment. I've decided that I could
                                                        combine The Path Of The Dabloons with Symfony, since all the
                                                        data used in the game can be easily managed in a CRUD system.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Firstly I established all the documentation for the website
                                                        (such as the needs analysis, functional design, the release
                                                        planning, the technical design and the Entity Relationship
                                                        Diagram). After the documentation
                                                        was ready I started programming the system:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>
                                                            In the 1st sprint I started with the starting pages (home,
                                                            about me, settings).
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            In the 2nd sprint I programmed simple functionalities such
                                                            as registering, logging in/out and the entities translated
                                                            from the Entity Relationship Diagram. Since I was done
                                                            sooner than
                                                            expected with these functionalities, I started working ahead
                                                            for a bit, where I added profile customizations, such as
                                                            changing your username, email and password.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>
                                                            In the 3rd sprint I have focused on member moderation
                                                            properties, which can be done by users with the moderator
                                                            role. This included allowing moderators to search for
                                                            members, temporarily
                                                            remove/ban members, permanently ban members and changing the
                                                            data of members in the case it was necessary. If you hadn't
                                                            noticed yet, this functionality has been based off of the
                                                            moderation functionality in project FNOJ, only made in
                                                            Symfony instead of vanilla PHP.

                                                        <li>
                                                            In the 4th sprint I've worked on the creator dashboard/admin
                                                            side of the application, the person who can manage the
                                                            content found within the application/game. This included
                                                            creating the
                                                            dashboard Reads and Deletes. Besides the creator dashboard,
                                                            the admin is also capable of managing members and
                                                            moderators.

                                                            In the 5th sprint I've worked on most Creates and Updates
                                                            for the entities in the creator dashboard. Besides these
                                                            functionalities I've also worked on creating the game page
                                                            where the game
                                                            will reside when everything is finished.

                                                            In the 6th sprint I've worked on creating the save file
                                                            system, which creates a 'player' where all data will be
                                                            bound to. Besides the save files I've worked on building an
                                                            API connected to the application,
                                                            which allows the front-end to request specific data in JSON
                                                            format, so that there can be a dynamic gameplay without
                                                            having to constantly refresh the webpage in order to access
                                                            information. I've also created
                                                            a rarity generation system so that the RNG system used in
                                                            the original game, is also (partially) implemented here.

                                                            improvements and bug fixes, so that the project would be
                                                            clear for review by the teachers.

                                            AEHT. A small set of schools is invited to this event, of which each gets to
                                            bring 1-2 students and a possible supervising
                                            teacher. During this event it's important that the students work together in
                                            a couple of teams where they discuss and document topics surrounding the
                                            local area they are visiting.</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0">My main task during this event was to get inspiration for the
                                            applications to see what could be added more to the event pages for the
                                            Youth Parliament, so that the event has more filler-content.
                                            Besides my main task I also kept up a blog with everything that
                                            happened/occurred during the event.</p>

                        I've made this portfolio, (and an earlier/older version of this) for school exercises. The
                        older version has been made with experience of just a few months, while this portfolio has
                        been made with experience of about a year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first 2 periods of school I had to seek inspiration (and of course) create my first
                        portfolio. I hadn't taken much time for this due to other school projects, but for this
                        current portfolio I have, which resulted in me being able to add much more.
                    </p>

                        You may see this portfolio get changed over the course of time when I learn more about
                        JavaScript/HTML/CSS or even new programming languages. I may work on it when I have time
                        available, to add more (and fun) features to make this look more lively. But for now,

                                                                                 class="text-primary redirect-btn">About Me</span>
                        page, I am not that
                        skilled in the designing of a website, which includes colors. If I have to be honest, I have
                        just picked some random colors and see how far I could get with those, which resulted in the
                        color scheme of this website. (Which is in my own opinion, not too bad).
                    </p>
